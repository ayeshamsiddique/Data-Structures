# Flight Management System (DSA Term Project)

## Overview:
  *This project is a Flight Management System developed in C++ to demonstrate the use of different     data structures including Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, and Graph (BFS).
  *The system allows users to manage flight data, compare search performance, and plan trips           between cities.

## Data Structures Used:
  * Binary Search Tree (BST)
  * AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)
  * Graph (BFS Traversal)

## Modules:

### 1. Flight Database (BST):
  * Store flight records using Flight ID as key
  * Insert, delete, search operations
  * Display flights in sorted order (Inorder traversal)
  * File handling using flights.txt

### 2. Flight Database (AVL):
  * Balanced tree implementation
  * Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
  * Count number of rotations
  * Compare search time with BST

### 3. Trip Planning (Graph - BFS):
  * Airports as vertices
  * Routes as edges (adjacency matrix)
  * Find minimum stops between airports
  * Display route path and traversal table

## Features:
  * Add, search, and delete flights
  * Display flights using BST and AVL
  * Compare performance (BST vs AVL)
  * Plan trips between cities using BFS
  * File handling for persistent data

## Files Included:
  * main.cpp
  * bst.h
  * avl.h
  * bfs.h
  * flights.txt
  * airports.txt
  * routes.txt

## Sample Functionalities:
  * Sorted flight display
  * AVL rotations tracking
  * Minimum stops calculation
  * Route path display

## Interface:
  Menu-driven console application:
      1. Add New Flight
      2. Search Flight
      3. Delete Flight
      4. Display Flights (BST)
      5. Display Flights (AVL)
      6. Compare Search Time
      7. Plan Trip (BFS)
      8. Exit

## Language:
  C++
